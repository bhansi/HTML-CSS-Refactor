## Steps Taken to Promote Accessibility

1. All ```<div>``` tags present in the HTML were changed to appropriate semantic tags.
2. All classes that were single use in the HTML were changed to ids, and the respective changes were also made to the CSS.
3. CSS was consolidated such that any instances of repeated code were moved into one block and other optimizations were made. Order of styling was also changed to be more logical.
4. All images in the webpage were given unique alt attributes to describe each image.
